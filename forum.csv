This was the reply I recieved:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear David \n\n\n\nThank you for your recent enquiry regarding Classic Car Rescue. \n\n\n\nWhile the production team were filming in Canada, the mechanics in London discovered some serious problems with the MGB, midway through the restoration, which meant they felt it might not be entirely safe to drive. Their original plan was to buy a new chassis, which is a common way that people restore MGBs (you can buy an entire new monocoque chassis for just \xc2\xa31000) and build on top of that. But wanting to stick with used parts, they bought another car and used the chassis from that, transferring much of the first MGB, right down to door-handles, and windows. The cost of the second car was included in the figures mentioned and the end result was a combination of the two. \n\n\n\nThe programme aims to show how Bernie Fineman and Mario Pacione cope with restoration jobs with a \xe2\x80\x9ctight deadline and an even tighter budget\xe2\x80\x9d in an entertaining fashion while also giving some background into why each selected model is held in the high regard that it is. It is not intended to, and does not claim to, demonstrate the detailed effort and finance that can go into the high end restoration of classic cars. \n\n\n\nNevertheless, this does not diminish the validity of your opinions and we are grateful to you for taking the time to make us aware of your concerns. Your comments have been logged in our Viewer Enquiries Report. This is circulated throughout the company and seen by all relevant personnel. \n\n\n\nThank you for your interest in Channel 5. \n\n\n\nYours sincerely \n\n\n\n\n\nIan \n\nVIEWER ADVISOR'"

On the last program I saw involving a classic car on this channel, they invited Frankie Fraser round for his 'expert' comments about a gangster car. Bug eyed Bernie was (according to him) also somehow involved on the fringes of Londons underworld and hinted at 'dark secrets' Dream on baby.\n\nThe programs are an insult to peoples intelligence. Total,complete and utter unmitigated drivel.\n\nFor people who know what they're doing you can't beat people like Tommy Walsh or Ed China,for engaging his audience and combining entertainment with presenting Fred Dibnah took some beating too."""

Then come back later and give \xc2\xa3250 for just the front seats.

I mean, they take more than two weeks to restore a car, they over-run on costs, their estimates for restoration are realistic as are their time schedules but they are very interesting people and are building a Bugatti Aerolithe from just photos - and in magnesium just like the original. I have recorded the series.'"
